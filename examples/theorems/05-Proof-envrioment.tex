\begin{lemma}
Given two line segments whose lengths are \(a\) and \(b\) respectively there 
is a real number \(r\) such that \(b=ra\).
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
To prove it by contradiction try and assume that the statement is false,
proceed from there and at some point you will arrive to a contradiction.
\end{proof}
